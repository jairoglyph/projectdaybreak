					The Apache Relay was formed by chance in a Nashville college dorm when Michael Ford Jr. (vocals) 
					met Mike Harris (guitar, vocals). Ford Jr. happened to be looking for some musicians to help perform 
					his own music live, when he heard about Harris' newly formed band, The Apache Relay. Ford Jr. hired 
					the trio, which also included Brett Moore (keys, guitar, mandolin) and Kellen Wenrich (fiddle, keys), 
					to back him at a show and it was immediately evident that the four musicians had a unique chemistry 
					and were on to something special.
				</p>
				<p>
                    The four-piece released their debut LP titled <em>1988</em> in 2009. Produced by Doug Williams, 
                    (renowned for his authentically raw approach with the Avett Brothers) the record was lauded by 
                    <em>Paste Magazine</em> as one of "The Eight Most Auspicious Musical Debuts of 2009". The band's ability 
                    to effortlessly blend acoustic sounds with ferocious rock anthem elements only hinted at the 
                    band's capabilities.
				</p>
				<p>
                    Capitalizing on the initial success of their debut with relentless touring, The Apache Relay honed 
                    their sound and released their sophomore album, <em>American Nomad</em>, in April 2011 throughout the US, via 
                    indie stalwart <em>Thirty Tigers</em>. Produced by Neilson Hubbard, the collection of modern roots-rock tracks 
                    encompassed the eclectic range of influences the band meshed so well; a tinge of Bad Brains, some Suzuki 
                    training, jazz lessons, a lot of Beatles' listening, a knowledge of traditional mountain music, a worship 
                    of Phil Spector and the love for the complex but accessible layers of bands like Arcade Fire. A few months 
                    later, Ford Jr.'s brother, Ben, joined the band. The brothers had been harmonizing and playing together 
                    since the age of 12 and 13, so it was a natural fit.
				</p>
				<p>
                    Since the release of <em>American Nomad</em>, The Apache Relay, have continued their regiment of non-stop 
                    touring, amassing a fervent fanbase and performing over 100 dates a year including coveted spots opening 
                    for Grammy award-winning Mumford &amp; Sons, and a breakout performance at Bonnaroo Music Festival. 2012 saw 
                    the band continue to tour in support of <em>American Nomad</em>, including stops at SXSW, Canadian Music Fest, and 
                    Newport Folk Festival. The band's first Canadian release, <em>American Nomad EP</em>, was released through 
                    Dine Alone Records on March 13, 2012. The EP includes selected tracks from the band's previous US full-length release.
				</p>
                <p>
                    In early 2013, The Apache Relay headed west to Los Angeles to begin work on their new album. Produced by Kevin Augunas, 
                    the band recorded at Fairfax Studios, formally known as the legendary Sound City Studios in Van Nuys. The new record 
                    will be released in early 2014.
                </p>

						and they're called The Apache Relay. They're a fantastic live band." &mdash; Huffington Post</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>"The Apache Relay's American Nomad, is an excellent effort from a musically skilled group with evident 
						appreciation for the rich, layered brand of American rock 'n' roll that pays homage to the road..." &mdash; Indie Shuffle</em>

					One of the principal architects of the Southern California sound, Mr. Souther played a key role in the formation of the Eagles 
					and cowrote the band's hits "Heartache Tonight," "Victim of Love," "New Kid in Town," and "Best of My Love," and Don Henley's 
					super hit "The Heart of the Matter," as well as writing Linda Ronstadt's classics "Faithless Love," "Simple Man, Simple Dream," 
					and "Prisoner in Disguise." A highly sought-after songwriter and session man, Mr. Souther also released three critically acclaimed 
					solo albums— John David Souther (1972), Black Rose (1976), and You're Only Lonely (1979).
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1984, Souther followed the chart-topping successes of "You're Only Lonely" and the James Taylor duet "Her Town Too" with 
					'Home by Dawn', an album that Rolling Stone and Time Magazine declared his best. He has collaborated with countless world-renowned 
					musicians including Bonnie Raitt, Warren Zevon, Don Henley, Linda Ronstadt, Paul Williams, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Hugh Masekela, 
					Burt Bacharach, Dixie Chicks, India Arie, Roy Orbison, Arthur Hamilton, George Strait, Brian Wilson and Trisha Yearwood.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following a leave of absence in 1985 to build his dream house, travel and spend time with his dogs (all rescues, of course), 
					Souther marked his return tosongwriting with three critically acclaimed albums, 'If World Was You' (Slow Curve Records), 
					'Rain: Live at the Belcourt' (Slow Curve Records), and ‘Natural History’ (eOne).  In 2007, he wrote the Eagles comeback single, 
					"How Long" which was featured on 'Long Road Out of Eden', their first studio album since 1979. In 2009, JD was presented with 
					the Golden Note Award at the 47th annual ASCAP Country Music Awards
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Fall of 2012, JD released 'Midnight in Tokyo' (eOne Music) and is featured on the hit ABC show Nashville as legendary 
					producer, songwriter and mentor Watty White.  JD's character "sees through the game on every level." A decade-long Nashville 
					resident, Souther tells Rolling Stone that the show "feels authentic to people in this world... for most of the people who live 
					here, they're thrilled there's finally a show in which they escape the usual stereotype."
				</p>
				<p>
					Souther's new album 'Midnight in Tokyo' (eONe Music) is a recent live collection of his music alongside Ellington and Ray Henderson; 
					an album he describes as "rough and smooth and wonderful; saloon music in the night." The live album was recorded on a recent trip 
					to Japan.
				</p>
				<p>
					JD Souther is proud to be an inductee for the 2013 Songwriters Hall of Fame.
